# Phase 9 — Nutrition / Physique as a Real Product Surface

Surface the existing physique-intelligence engine as a decisive top-level verdict, and make nutrition ↔ training feel like one system.

**Physique verdict (new shared surface)**
- [x] `PhysiqueVerdictCard` hero component — answers "am I on track?" in ≤1s
- [x] Semantic verdict state (success / warning / danger / info) driven by `PhysiqueIntelligenceEngine`
- [x] Compact metric strip: trend kg/wk · target kg/wk · protein hit rate · recovery
- [x] Signal-confidence line (strong / moderate / weak + weigh-in + nutrition day count)
- [x] Calibration state when data is insufficient (not a blank card)

**Body Progress surface (BodyWeightLogView)**
- [x] Replace the goal-pace card with `PhysiqueVerdictCard` as the hero
- [x] Regression-based weekly trend (from engine) drives the verdict instead of crude 3-vs-3
- [x] Keep chart, but trend chip now reflects verdict state color

**Nutrition surface (NutritionLogView)**
- [x] `PhysiqueVerdictCard` hero above target overview
- [x] Nutrition × training bridge line using `recoveryTrainingBridge`
- [x] Target overview demoted to a compact secondary card

**Consistency**
- [x] Both surfaces read from the same verdict — no parallel truths
- [x] Reuse `STRQPalette` state colors (no ad-hoc color maps)
- [x] Dark, premium, structured — no calorie-tracker clutter

**Identity**
- [x] Keep dark premium identity and coach authority
- [x] No redesign of unrelated screens
